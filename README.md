# 👋 Hey there, I'm Shahbaz Ali

Welcome to my GitHub

## 💻 What I Do

### 🧠 Backend Engineering
- **Django + DRF** — I build RESTful APIs that don't just work — they scale.
- **Python** — My language of choice for everything from microservices to data pipelines.
- **Microservices Architecture** — I prefer services to be autonomous, loosely coupled, and built for failure.
- **Kafka** — Event-driven systems are my jam. I use Kafka to decouple and distribute services with ease.

### 🌍 DevOps + Deployment
- **Docker** — I containerize everything. Clean, portable, and production-ready.
- **Kubernetes** — Orchestrating services at scale using K8s. Helm, ConfigMaps, StatefulSets, you name it.
- **CI/CD** — Automating deployment pipelines to minimize downtime and manual overhead.

### 🧱 Blockchain Development
- **Ethereum / Solidity** — I've written and deployed smart contracts, mainly on EVM-compatible chains.
- **Dapps** — I build decentralized frontends and integrate them securely with smart contracts.

### 🖼️ Frontend (when needed)
- **React.js** — I use React when I want to keep things modern, fast, and maintainable on the frontend.

### 🗃️ Databases
- PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB — I choose the right tool for the data workload, whether it's transactional, real-time, or distributed.
